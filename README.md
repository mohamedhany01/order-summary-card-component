## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG
- Webpack 5

### What I learned

I have upgraded my skills with front-end development by applying concepts like mobile-first and responsive design and learned more about using SVG in this challenge. 

I have learned how to use a new tool. I could say a gorgeous gadget Webpack 5. A powerful bundler that helped me to bundle my project into one organized folder.
